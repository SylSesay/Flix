### Notes
I finished this assignment on time, but the superhero page was empty. None of the posters appeared; so for the next days after I reviewed the walkthrough from the very beginning to see what I missed, yet the problem was still never resolved. I walked through it for a thired time to perfection and the problem was still not resolved. I even searched up how to fix it one the web and also Github, but it seemed like no one had the same problem as me.
